# The Game of Life in Processing

This is very basic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It's pretty much straight up stolen from Daniel Shiffman's example in [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com). Buy this book! Seriously, you will thank me.
